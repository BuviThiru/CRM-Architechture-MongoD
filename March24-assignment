Archetectural Design:
Architectural design I would prefer is SOA
Because the application is very big and monolithic architecture will not help.
If we use SOA, following advantages can be harvested...
             1. Scalability will be easy.
             2. security can be taken care
             3. The whole project can be divided into multiple small services
             4. If the service is really small it can be shared inside bigger service code base
             5.DB can be shared by different services if the have common data
